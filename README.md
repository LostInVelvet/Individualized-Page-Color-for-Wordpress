# Individualized Page Color for Wordpress

This plugin allows a site owner to set a specific background color for each page. 


To use:

1. Copy and paste the shortcode onto any page or post you want. (It may not work as expected with the front page depending on the theme.)
2. Change the numbers after 'color=#' to whatever hex code you want. "hex codes" are the standard numbers and letters used to define a color. For example "000" is black. <a href="http://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/">Here is one online color chooser</a>.

Shortcode Example: [bg_color color=#000]
